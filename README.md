# 🚗 Car Price Prediction — OIBSIP Data Science Internship Task 1

This project is part of the **Oasis Infobyte Data Science Internship**.  
The goal of this task is to build a **Machine Learning model** that can accurately predict the selling price of cars based on various attributes such as brand, year, mileage, fuel type, and transmission.

---

## 📘 Objective
To develop a regression model that can estimate car prices using historical data and key vehicle features.

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Google Colab

## ⚙️ Steps Performed
1. **Data Loading & Cleaning** — handled missing values and corrected data types.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** — visualized patterns and relationships among variables.  
3. **Feature Engineering** — encoded categorical data and scaled numerical features.  
4. **Model Building** — applied multiple regression algorithms (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.).  
5. **Model Evaluation** — compared models using R² score, MAE, and RMSE metrics.  
6. **Prediction** — generated predictions for test data.

## 📊 Results
- The model achieved strong predictive accuracy on unseen data.  
- **Random Forest Regressor** performed best among tested models.  
- Demonstrated the relationship between price and important features like year, mileage, and fuel type.
